# Lab 02: Maximum

## Objectives
1. Read data from the keyboard.
2. Compose boolean expressions using comparison operators.
3. Implement conditional logic (if, else, and elif).

## Program Description
This program will prompt the user to enter three integer numbers and determine the maximum of these three numbers.

## Program Specifications
1. Create a new class called `Maximum`.
2. Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the keyboard.
3. Declare four integer variables named:
   - `number1`
   - `number2`
   - `number3`
   - `max`
4. Prompt the user to enter values for variables `number1`, `number2`, and `number3`.
5. Find the maximum of `number1`, `number2`, and `number3`, then assign it to the `max` variable.
6. Display the maximum value.

## Sample Output
```
This program finds the maximum of three integer numbers.
Enter the 1st integer: 1
Enter the 2nd integer: -1
Enter the 3rd integer: 0
The maximum is 1
```

## Coding Standards
1. Remove any comments generated by your IDE.
2. Include documentation that contains your name.
3. Write descriptive comments to explain the code, if necessary.
4. Ensure user-friendly output messages.
5. Format code in a way that is easy to read.
